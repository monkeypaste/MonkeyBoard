# MonkeyBoard.Builder

## Usage

This is a small console app that transforms machine readable emoji listings ([example](https://unicode.org/Public/emoji/15.1/emoji-test.txt)) into a special resx file that MonkeyBoard uses for its available emojis and their respective meta-information.

It also flattens android xml keyboard formats into MonkeyBoard compatible json files (see comments in KeyboardBuilder.cs for more info)

**CAUTION**
This is a pretty messy process, if anyone ever actually wants to use this just let me know what's wrong I'll be happy help :)
